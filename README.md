# Project-Portfolio-E-commerce-data-Analysis

In this E-commerce state Sales Power Data Analysis project, an exploratory data analysis was performed on the E-commerce Sales Data available on Kaggle. 
The main aim of the project is to uncover insights into the E-commerce data and profits trends and patterns from 2018 to 2019. After cleaning and preprocessing the data,
the profits trends were visualized by states, region, category, sub-category and timeline (years or quarters). Additionally, 
top-performing, least-performing products and the most profitable customers were identified. After, the data is displayed in a Power Bi interactive dashboard. 
2 versions of the dashboard exist. A yearly focus and a quarterly focus. 
The analysis below provided valuable insights into the E-commerce data and profits performance and identified areas for improvement. 
The project demonstrated the usefulness of Power Bi in data analysis and decision-making.
